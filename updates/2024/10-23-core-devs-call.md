        * Planning for the mainnet release

# Testing

## Ethereum/tests
* Integrating t8n by Nethermind
# Client updates
## EL
### Nethermind
* 1.29.1 solves the block creation problem
    * Official release and pushed to Dappnodes etc
    * No missing slots anymore
* Worked on a new Shutter release for 1.29.1, which was released as 1.29.2
* Release 1.30 planned in 1-2 weeks
* Worked with Twinstake
* Should be able to focus more on 44s
* Implemented an endpoint that should allow Nethermind to be used as a block builder
### Erigon
* No particular updates
* Working on devnet 4 and devnet 5
* Will start working on joining Gnosis Devnet 1 as soon as itâ€™s published
### Geth
* This the rebase to the latest 1.14 version (1.14.11)
    * Which should support live tracer
    * Should be ready for Gnosis Devnet 1
        * Missing blob fee collector change
* Snap sync works
* Block building works on mainnet (Gnosis is running 52 validators)
* Still in the process of doing a full sync, but will last at least 2-3 weeks
    * Still pre-merge currently, everything works until there at least

### Reth
* Working on importing the post-merge state from geth or any other client
    * Geth seems to have a command to export the state
        * Guillaume thinks that it might not work
* Waiting for t8ntool

## CL
#### Pectra
* Gnosis Devnet 0
    * Based on devnet 3
    * Should probably move to devnet 4 (for Gnosis Devnet 1)
        * Both Nethermind and Erigon agrees, especially because 3 is not compatible with 4 at all

# Research
* No updates
